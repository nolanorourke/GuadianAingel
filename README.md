## Motiviation
My Grandma was the victim of multiple different malware attacks, one being the most evil rancid browser hijacker that took a lot of fighting to get rid of. Anyway i can't always be there, so i figured i should create something that can watch over her while i wasnt available

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to protect from phishing attacks as well as to learn, not just about possible applicaiton programming but AI. I want to use python libraries to train AI and to understand how training a model works 

## How it works
It uses an AI that has been trained based off of previous scam emails and detects similar language within current emails to see if they might contain malicious intent

## What makes this different
Me. I am writing it so its different. I also am not writing it for a commercial setting, it is specifically for my grandma
